# KEYSGPTENGINEER
found a random fork of a gpt engineer that implemented python snippets of the sort when asked a question. I just wanted a GPT  that would do everything that was within ethical boundaries. I have not tested or de-bugged or really messed with this yet aside from stacking the files fixing a lot of typos and broken typescript errors.. now it's TIME!
